# analyzing-customer-churn

Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data to identify key factors and provide actionable insights for a telecommunications company. The analysis was conducted using a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, focusing on customer demographics, service usage, and payment behavior.

1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs provide a high-level overview of the company's customer base and churn performance.

KPI	Value	Description
Total Customers	6,687	The total number of customers in the dataset.
Churned Customers	1,796	The total number of customers who have churned.
Overall Churn Rate	26.86%	The percentage of customers lost, indicating a significant retention challenge.
Avg. Customer Service Calls	0.92	The average number of calls per customer, suggesting that most customers do not require frequent support.
Avg. Extra International Charges	$33.64	A key metric highlighting potential sources of customer dissatisfaction.
Avg. Extra Data Charges	$3.37	The average amount of extra charges for data usage.

2. Key Insights from the Analysis
A deep-dive into the data revealed several critical insights into customer behavior and churn drivers.

Pricing and Value Proposition are the Primary Churn Drivers:

The top two reasons for churn were identified as "Competitor made a better offer" and "Price too high".

Churn is directly correlated with higher monthly charges, especially for new customers.

This indicates a gap in the company's value proposition and competitive pricing.

Churn is Segment-Specific and Varies with Customer Tenure:

New Customers (Age 20-40): This segment shows a high churn rate in their first year (1-12 months), but their loyalty increases significantly afterward, with churn dropping to near zero for long-term customers.

Senior Customers (Age 65+): This group exhibits a consistently high churn rate across all account tenures, suggesting a persistent, long-term issue related to service complexity or support.

Contract Type and Payment Method are Critical Indicators of Churn:

Monthly contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to yearly contracts.

Customers on monthly contracts using Direct Debit are the most at-risk segment, showing a churn rate of 53.90% and higher average customer service calls, pointing to potential billing or service issues.

Data Plan Performance is a Hidden Churn Factor:

A high churn rate of 33.57% was observed among customers with an "unlimited data plan" who consume a moderate amount of data (5-10 GB).

This suggests a potential disconnect between the perceived value of the "unlimited" plan and the actual service delivered (e.g., speed throttling, hidden limitations), leading to customer frustration.

3. Strategic Recommendations
Based on the insights, the following strategic recommendations are proposed to mitigate churn and improve customer retention.

Develop a Targeted Retention Strategy:

For New Customers: Implement a proactive engagement and onboarding program to reinforce value in the first 12 months.

For Senior Customers: Designate specialized support channels and simplify billing and service-related communication to address their persistent retention issues.

Optimize Pricing and Service Value:

Benchmark pricing against competitors and re-evaluate the company's value proposition.

Enhance the transparency of "unlimited" data plans, clearly communicating any limitations to manage customer expectations effectively.

Incentivize Long-Term Commitment:

Introduce compelling offers and discounts to encourage new customers to choose yearly contracts over monthly ones.

Address specific pain points for customers using Direct Debit on monthly contracts to reduce their high churn rate.

Leverage Geographic Analysis:

Analyze churn rates and customer service call volumes by state to identify and address regional-specific issues, such as local competitor dominance or infrastructure problems.
