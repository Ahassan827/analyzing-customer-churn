# analyzing-customer-churn

📈Project Overview:

This project analyzes customer churn data to identify key factors and provide actionable insights for a telecommunications company. The analysis was conducted using a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, focusing on customer demographics, service usage, and payment behavior.

🚀 The Big Picture:

Our Key Performance Indicators
Before the analysis, let's look at the numbers. They tell a story of a company with a significant retention challenge.

🎯 KPI	

. Total Customers	6,687	

. Churned Customers	1,796

. Overall Churn Rate	26.86%

. Avg. Customer Service Calls	0.92	

. Avg. Extra International Charges	$33.64

🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis:

A deep-dive into the data revealed several critical insights into customer behavior and churn drivers.

1. Pricing and Value Proposition are the Primary Churn Drivers:

The top two reasons for churn were identified as "Competitor made a better offer" and "Price too high".

Churn is directly correlated with higher monthly charges, especially for new customers.

This indicates a gap in the company's value proposition and competitive pricing.

2. Churn is Segment-Specific and Varies with Customer Tenure:

New Customers (Age 20-40): This segment shows a high churn rate in their first year (1-12 months), but their loyalty increases significantly afterward, with churn dropping to near zero for long-term customers.

Senior Customers (Age 65+): This group exhibits a consistently high churn rate across all account tenures, suggesting a persistent, long-term issue related to service complexity or support.

3. Contract Type and Payment Method are Critical Indicators of Churn:

Monthly contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to yearly contracts.

Customers on monthly contracts using Direct Debit are the most at-risk segment, showing a churn rate of 53.90% and higher average customer service calls, pointing to potential billing or service issues.

4. Data Plan Performance is a Hidden Churn Factor:

A high churn rate of 33.57% was observed among customers with an "unlimited data plan" who consume a moderate amount of data (5-10 GB).

This suggests a potential disconnect between the perceived value of the "unlimited" plan and the actual service delivered (e.g., speed throttling, hidden limitations), leading to customer frustration.

🛠️ Actionable Recommendations:

From Insights to Impact
Here’s a strategic roadmap to turn these insights into business results.

🤝 Incentivize Loyalty:

Offer significant discounts or perks to encourage customers to switch from monthly to more stable, yearly contracts.
